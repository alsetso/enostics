# Enostics AI Integration PRD
# Integrating Claude Code & Task Master into Universal Personal API Platform

## Project Overview

Enostics is the universal personal API layer for every individual, giving users a persistent, intelligent, programmable endpoint. This PRD outlines the integration of Claude Code (Anthropic's agentic coding tool) and Task Master AI (intelligent task management) into the Enostics platform.

## Vision

Transform every Enostics user endpoint into an intelligent development workstation and autonomous task executor, accessible via their personal API endpoints.

## Core Objectives

1. **Intelligent Coding Assistant**: Users can access Claude Code through `/v1/:username/code/*` endpoints
2. **Smart Task Management**: Users can manage projects through `/v1/:username/tasks/*` endpoints  
3. **Unified AI Dashboard**: Integrated UI for both tools in the Enostics dashboard
4. **API-First Architecture**: All functionality accessible via REST API and UI
5. **User Endpoint Enhancement**: Every user's personal API becomes a development platform

## Key Features

### Claude Code Integration
- Headless Claude Code API wrapper
- Session management for multiple concurrent coding sessions
- Workspace isolation per user
- Git integration and project context management
- Real-time coding assistance through user endpoints

### Task Master Integration  
- AI-powered project planning and task generation
- Intelligent task breakdown and complexity analysis
- Research-backed task insights using fresh data
- Dependency management and workflow optimization
- Progress tracking and automated status updates

### Dashboard Enhancement
- New "Dev Studio" section in Enostics dashboard
- Real-time coding session viewer
- Task management interface
- Integration logs and analytics
- User permission and access controls

### API Endpoints
- `/api/ai/code` - Claude Code integration endpoints
- `/api/ai/tasks` - Task Master integration endpoints
- `/api/v1/:username/code/*` - User-specific coding endpoints
- `/api/v1/:username/tasks/*` - User-specific task endpoints

## Technical Requirements

### Infrastructure
- Node.js integration with installed Claude Code CLI
- Task Master AI npm package integration
- Session management for concurrent users
- Workspace isolation and security
- Rate limiting and resource management

### Security
- User authentication and authorization
- Workspace sandboxing
- API key management
- Data privacy and encryption
- Audit logging for all AI operations

### Performance
- Asynchronous processing for long-running tasks
- Session cleanup and resource management
- Caching for frequently accessed data
- Scalable architecture for multiple users

## User Stories

### As a Developer
- I want to access Claude Code through my Enostics endpoint
- I can manage coding projects via API calls
- I can get AI assistance for debugging and development
- I can track my coding sessions and history

### As a Project Manager
- I want to create and manage tasks through my endpoint
- I can generate project plans from requirements documents
- I can track team progress and dependencies
- I can get AI insights on project complexity

### As an API User
- I can integrate these tools into my own applications
- I can automate development workflows through API calls
- I can access both tools through a single Enostics endpoint
- I can manage permissions and access controls

## Success Metrics

- User adoption rate of AI features
- Number of successful coding sessions
- Task completion and project success rates
- API endpoint usage and engagement
- User satisfaction and feedback scores

## Implementation Priority

1. **Phase 1**: Basic Claude Code integration and API endpoints
2. **Phase 2**: Task Master integration and task management
3. **Phase 3**: Dashboard UI and user interface
4. **Phase 4**: Advanced features and optimizations

## Constraints

- Must maintain Enostics' endpoint-first architecture
- Security and privacy are paramount
- Should scale to handle multiple concurrent users
- Must integrate seamlessly with existing Enostics features
- Performance should not impact core platform functionality

## Dependencies

- Claude Code CLI tool (already installed)
- Task Master AI npm package (already installed)
- Anthropic API access for Claude functionality
- Additional AI provider APIs (OpenAI, etc.)
- User authentication and session management

## Risks & Mitigation

- **Resource Usage**: Implement rate limiting and session timeouts
- **Security**: Sandbox workspaces and validate all inputs
- **Scalability**: Use async processing and resource pooling
- **API Costs**: Implement usage tracking and billing integration

## Timeline

- Week 1-2: Core API integration and basic endpoints
- Week 3-4: Dashboard UI and user interface
- Week 5-6: Testing, optimization, and deployment
- Week 7+: Monitoring, feedback, and iterative improvements
